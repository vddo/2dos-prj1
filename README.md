First time working together

## Do this 
First time working together so lets implement some routines.
1. Check for changes `git status`
2. Pull the most recent repository `git pull` (I haven't tried it, yet. But Should be the right thing to do)
3. When working on new features make a new branch 
  - Create new branch `git branch <new branch name>` 
  - Switch branches `git switch <branch to switch to>`
4. Commit your work as often as possible.
  - Stage changed files `git add <file 1> <file x>` or `git add .` (stage all files)
  - Commit changes `git commit -m "Some message"`
  - After doing that the first time you can stage and commit all files at the same time `git commit -am "Some message"`
5. Push changes to the cloud `git push`
